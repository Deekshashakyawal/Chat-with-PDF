# 📄 Chat with PDF (RAG App)

A **Streamlit-based AI application** that allows users to upload PDFs and chat with them using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** powered by LangChain, ChromaDB, HuggingFace embeddings, and Groq LLM.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📂 Upload PDF files
* 🧠 Ask questions from PDF content
* 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG)
* ⚡ Fast embeddings using HuggingFace (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
* 🤖 LLM responses using Groq (LLaMA 3.1)
* 📚 Page number references in answers
* 🌐 Simple Streamlit UI

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-with-pdf.git
cd chat-with-pdf
```

---

### 2️⃣ Create virtual environment (IMPORTANT)

Use Python **3.10 recommended**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4️⃣ Setup environment variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

---

### 5️⃣ Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads a PDF
2. PDF is split into chunks
3. Chunks are embedded using HuggingFace embeddings
4. Stored in Chroma vector database
5. User asks a question
6. Relevant chunks are retrieved
7. Groq LLM generates answer using retrieved context

## 📌 Example Usage

* “What is this document about?”
* “Summarize page 2”
* “What are the key points?”
* “Explain section 3 in simple terms”

---

## ⚠️ Requirements Notes

* Use **Python 3.10** for best compatibility
* Avoid Python 3.11+ due to ChromaDB build issues
* Ensure stable versions of LangChain packages

---

## 🔥 Future Improvements

* 📄 Multi-PDF chat support
* ⚡ Streaming responses (ChatGPT-like typing effect)
* 📌 Highlight answers in PDF
* 💾 Persistent chat memory per file
